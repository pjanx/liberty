liberty
=======

`liberty' is a pseudolibrary of all the common C code I have written for various
projects.  It can be thought of as a successor to my other C library, libxtnd.

You are supposed to import it as a git submodule and include the main source
file directly everywhere you need it.  Everything is declared "static".  I have
come to the conclusion that this style of C programming suits me the best, as it
allows me to nearly forget about the mess that are header files.
